<h1>Comparative Study of Vehicle Inventory, Gasoline Prices, and CO2 Emissions</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project presents a comprehensive exploration of vehicle inventory, gasoline prices, CO2 emissions, and vehicle sales by fuel type in the United States from 1993 to 2014. Through interactive visualizations, the dataset reveals insightful trends and patterns.
</p>

<p>
The analysis focuses on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Interactive line chart showcasing nationwide averages over time, capturing the nation's evolution and providing a compelling narrative.</li>
<li>Dynamic visualization of vehicle inventory sales by state and fuel type, offering unique insights into sales patterns across different regions.</li>  
<li>Engaging display of market shares and shifting trends among fuel types, shedding light on the competitive landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These visualizations illuminate the complexities of vehicle-related data, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights for informed decision-making. The project showcases the untapped potential for a sustainable future in the automotive industry.
</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>
Three datasets were sourced from government databases:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Vehicle Inventory:</b> Sourced from the U.S. Department of Energy [6]. Contains state and county-wise percentage vehicle sales for different fuel types.</li>
<li><b>Gasoline Prices:</b> Sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) [4]. Contains average gasoline prices per barrel for each state and year.</li>  
<li><b>CO2 Emissions:</b> Sourced from the EIA [1]. Contains state energy-related CO2 emissions and per capita CO2 emissions.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<h3>Nationwide</h3>

<p>
The analysis of nationwide averages revealed a positive correlation between gasoline prices and the inventory of vehicles powered by clean fuel, both of which exhibited an inverse correlation to energy-related CO2 emissions per capita.
</p>

<p>
The dominance of gas-powered vehicles remained consistent but clean fuels increased, indicating rising interest in sustainable options since the 2000s. This shift aligns with key events in EV innovation history and fluctuations in gasoline prices. 
</p>

<h3>By State</h3>

<p>
Visualizations revealed regional variations in vehicle sales and fuel types:
</p>

<ul>
<li>West coast states like California had more clean fuel vehicles.</li> 
<li>Gas prices impacted consumer behavior and adoption of fuel efficient options.</li>
<li>Policies and incentives promoted clean energy adoption in certain states.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geospatial</h3>

<p>
Interactive choropleth maps displayed gasoline prices by state and over time. This allowed analysis of price trends and regional variations.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
The visualizations and analyses provided valuable insights into trends and shifts in the automotive industry over 20 years. The results highlight the potential for sustainable transportation and can inform stakeholder decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Repository Contents</h2>

<p>
The repository contains:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Notebooks:</b> For data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.</li>
<li><b>Data:</b> Cleaned CSV files for vehicle inventory, gasoline, and emissions.</li>  
<li><b>Figures:</b> Generated graphs and visualizations.</li>
<li><b>Report:</b> Full methodology, analysis, and conclusions.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
The notebooks require Python packages like Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Geopandas, and Folium.
